# Wiegand Display

This project is meant for demonstrating technology downgrade attacks by displaying the PACS data sent over Wiegand.  

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Arduino (Tested with Wemos D1 Mini & Arduino UNO R3) should work with others
- 0.91 Inch I2C SSD1306 OLED Display Module other sizes should work
- RFID Reader or device that generates Wiegand output

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- [WiegandNG](https://github.com/jpliew/Wiegand-NG-Multi-Bit-Wiegand-Library-for-Arduino) Library **Note:** For esp8266 platform apply the changes from [here](https://github.com/jpliew/Wiegand-NG-Multi-Bit-Wiegand-Library-for-Arduino/pull/6)
- [Adafruit SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) Library



## Demonstration
